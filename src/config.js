  aboutMeContent: "\
  Two roads diverged in a yellow wood, \n \
  And sorry I could not travel both \n \
  And be one traveler, long I stood \n \
  And looked down one as far as I could \n \
  To where it bent in the undergrowth; \n \
  Then took the other, as just as fair, \n \
  And having perhaps the better claim, \n \
  Because it was grassy and wanted wear; \n \
  Though as for that the passing there \n \
  Had worn them really about the same, \n \
  And both that morning equally lay \n \
  In leaves no step had trodden black. \n \
  Oh, I kept the first for another day! \n \
  Yet knowing how way leads on to way, \n \
  I doubted if I should ever come back. \n \
  I shall be telling this with a sigh \n \
  Somewhere ages and ages hence: \n \
  Two roads diverged in a wood, and I- \n \
  I took the one less traveled by, \n \
  And that has made all the difference. \n"
